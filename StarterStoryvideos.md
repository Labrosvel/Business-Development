## 1. Market Input & Inspiration (20 minutes)
👉 “Watch StarterStory videos intentionally”
Purpose: expose your brain to monetisable, small-but-real ideas.
- What exactly made money?
- What problem did they solve?
- How did they validate demand?
- What is the simplest version of their product?
- Capture 3–5 insights in your idea notebook (Notion, Google Doc, or a .md file).

## 2. Document Your App Ideas (15 minutes)
Brain dump anything in your head:
- Problems you’ve seen at Home Office
- Tools analysts always say they wish they had
- Automation that could save hours
- Something you built before that could be productised
- Something you can build in 48 hours

### Format (keep it simple):
- Problem
- Who experiences it
- How often
- How painful
- Quick solution idea
- Monetisation options
- Competitors (if any)
This builds your personal **opportunity pipeline**.
